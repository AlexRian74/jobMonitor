This project accomplishes the following:
1. Gathers job postings from 6 different job boards (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, Monster, Google).
2. Utilizes the OpenAI API to extract job requirements from each job posting.
3. Compares the provided user's resume to job requirements.
4. Generates a report that contains all positions that matched the user's resume and those that didn't.
Since it was initially a personal project,6. I won't delve into the details unless there is expressed interest. The primary goal of this project is to simplify job searching.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask, and I'll be happy to provide answers.
